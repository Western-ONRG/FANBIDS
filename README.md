# FANBIDS: Framework for Analysis of NIRS with BIDS

Due to unforeseen circumstances, the "FANBIDS Utility for MATLAB" has not yet been released but it will be made available here once it is ready. I will be away for most of October so the current ETA is November 2022.

In the meantime, consider using FANBIDS' predecessor here: https://github.com/BrainsCAN-fNIRS/fNIRS_Tools
